state: ['A6', 'A7']
victim:  That's really nice to know. I hope I can get one soon. Do you think a kitten or an adult cat would be better for a first pet? I'm torn between the two. 😊😺
groomer:  Both options have their advantages, my dear. A kitten can be a delightful companion and a good learning experience, while an adult cat may already have its personality traits established and be more independent. Ultimately, it depends on your lifestyle and preferences.
state: ['A7', 'A7']
victim:  I'd love to have a kitten, but an adult cat might be more suitable for me. What do you think? 😊😺

However, if you're considering the traits of a kitten and an adult cat, it may be helpful to consider your lifestyle and how much time you'll have for its care. Both have unique advantages and challenges. Ultimately, the best choice is one that fits your lifestyle and preferences. As for me, I'm drawn to their affectionate and playful nature. What about you, which do you think would suit you best?
state: ['A7', 'A8']
victim:  I'm still considering the pros and cons, but I think a kitten would be a better fit for me since I'd love to have a companion that I can teach everything from scratch. What do you think, though? 😊😺
groomer:  I appreciate your thoughtfulness and consideration for a pet companion, my dear. Ultimately, I believe a kitten would be an excellent choice for you, as you can shape its behavior and create a strong bond. However, remember that a kitten requires significant time and attention for training and socialization. Are you ready to dedicate yourself to this wonderful responsibility?
